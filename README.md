# ComputationalGeometry
This is a project that enables the user to build 1)Vornoi diagrams, 2)Delauney triangulations and 3)Convex hulls (conceps studied by a branch of computer science devoted to the study of algorithms which can be stated in terms of geometry) in two dimensional space out of the sets of poins provided by the user.
To try it out -- download the project, build and then run it (by using compile and run scripts included in the project root directory).
